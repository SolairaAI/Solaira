## **API Key**
To use SOLAIRA, you need a [DeepSeek AI API key](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys). Obtain your API key from [DeepSeek AI](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) and configure it in your project.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: SOLAIRA is not affiliated with DeepSeek AI but uses it as a base AI for its agents.

## Usage Examples
### Synchronous Example
```
from SOLAIRA import SOLAIRA

# Initialize the SOLAIRA client
api = SOLAIRA(api_key="your_deepseek_api_key")

# Call the API endpoint synchronously
response = api.call_endpoint(
    text="Analyze Solana wallet activity",
    chain="solana",
    deep_mode=True,
    max_tokens=500,
    temperature=0.7,
    stream=False
)

# Print the response
print("Response Data:", response.data)
print("Metadata:", response.metadata)
```
### Asynchronous Example
```
import asyncio
from SOLAIRA import SOLAIRAAsync

async def main():
    # Initialize the SOLAIRA async client
    api = SOLAIRAAsync(api_key="your_deepseek_api_key")

    # Call the API endpoint asynchronously
    response = await api.call_endpoint(
        text="Predict market trends for Solana",
        chain="solana",
        deep_mode=False,
        max_tokens=500,
        temperature=0.7,
        stream=False
    )

    # Print the response
    print("Response Data:", response.data)
    print("Metadata:", response.metadata)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```
